# Infra-Ansible

Infrastructure Automation with Ansible.

## Getting Started

### Useful Ad-Hoc commands

Grabbed from the book *Ansible for DevOps*

> pending

### Local testing environment with Vagrant

> Applying Ansible playbooks to production environment without testing it is very dangerous.

[vagrant]: https://www.vagrantup.com/

With [Vagrant][vagrant], we could:

- Configure a local testing virtual machine in text file (Vagrantfile)
- Configure many virtual machines and orchestrate them together
- Automate the whole life of many virtual machines

Using the GUI (VirtualBox, VMware etc.) to configure virtual machines is just fine. Nonetheless, we still recommend using Vagrant for more thorough automation.
